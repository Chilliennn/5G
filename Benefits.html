		<h2>
			What Is The Benefits Of 5G To Business And Society?
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Autonomous Driving
		</h3>
		<p>
			5G's low latency means we could see self-driving cars becoming more common, with roads connected with transmitters and sensors that can send and receive 
			<br>information to vehicles in 1/1,000 of a second. Less time is critical for AI and radar technology to interpret what they see (other cars, pedestrians, 
			<br>stop signs) and control the car accordingly.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Smart Factory
		</h3>
		<p>
			5G enables the Internet of Things , which means factories can wirelessly connect thousands of smart devices, such as cameras and sensors, to automatically
			<br>collect data in real time. Factories can analyze and process this data to improve operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Environment
		</h3>
		<p>
			5G has the potential to help reduce global emissions. One of the advantages of 5G compared to previous networks is the transmission efficiency and the low <br>power consumption it uses. It will also enable real-time monitoring of emissions, air quality, water quality and other environmental indicators.
